Dear Yong,

The link below include the Vision Demo that I showed in Shenzhen along with an build of YAKS for Linux. The build is statically linked thus I hope should run w/o issues. FYI, it was built on an Ubuntu.

Take a look at the read-me and let me know if you have any issues. If you want to start YAKS with verbose output do:

./yaksd.exe --verbosity=debug

If you want to see the various parameters, do:

./yaksd.exe --help


BTW, in order to be able to run the demo you have to install the python API for YAKS along with all a bunch of python libraries for computer vision, do:

pip3 install yaks
pip3 install face_recognition

This should probably pull all required dependencies.

Please don¿t hesitate to call me on WhatsApp if you encounter any issues.

Ciao,
Angelo
